## Overview ##

This dataset contains an Excel file and GeoJSON point features for Colorado Environment Organizations.
The initial focus is the Poudre Basin, but organizations for other areas will be added over time.

For visualization purposes, Statewide organizations are located near the Poudre confluence with the South Platte.
This may change in the future as additional basins are added to the dataset.
